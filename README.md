# SDCND_4thProject_AdvancedLaneDetection

Project: Advanced Lane detection i.e. to detect the lanes and shade the areas between the identified lanes from the input video stream

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
  1. Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
  2. Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
  3. Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
  4. Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
  5. Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
  6. Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
  7. Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
  8. Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.
  
  
  I have used the codes present in the the sdcnd and referred the open forum portals. 
  
  
  The Project contains the below folders/files,
  1. AdvancedLaneDetection_Main.ipynb - Main script
  2. output_images - All the output images are saved in this folder
  3. project_video.mp4 - The input video file used in the script 
  4. project_video_output.mp4 - The generated output video file
  5. utils - Folder contains all the code
